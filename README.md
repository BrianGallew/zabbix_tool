Zabbix Tools
===========

# zabbix_tool

It provides for "simple" CLI access to various Zabbix objects.  It is far
from complete, yet is very useful in it's current state.

# screen_creator

Useful for creating screens in Zabbix.  Can add all of the graphs from a
single host to the screen, as well as adding a single named graph from
every host in a hostgroup.
